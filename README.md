This contains the VBA code made to assist me with my job. I found the work repetive, so I thought, "there has to be a way to make this easier".
I turned a task that took a few minutes into 30 seconds. I refined the code enough to improve it to less than 1, dependent on the amount of data.

Each .bas file is a VBA module in Excel, where runAll.bas calls each module.

As my first working-life project, I focused on results rather than truly "good" code, and added into faster runtime changes later.
